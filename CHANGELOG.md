## v0.0.9 (12/30/11)

* Added check to make sure property exists on Task model before assigning.
* Removing some unused properties from the Task model

## v0.0.5 (6/5/11)

* Added "depends" method to task model so that tasks that use depends will not
  throw errors.

  done.

* Added "priority" to list of attributes (no more errors)
* Added sorting by priority first
