# Web Interface for Taskwarrior

A lightweight, Sinatra-based web interface for the
wonderful [Taskwarrior](http://taskwarrior.org/) todo application.

## Installation

`gem install taskwarrior-web`

This will install an executable called `task-web`

## Usage

`task-web` at your terminal to start it up. This will start the process,
background it, and open the URL in your browser.

It uses [Vegas](https://github.com/quirkey/vegas/) to make the Sinatra app into
an executable, so all options for Vegas are valid for `task-web`. Type
`task-web -h` for more options.

## Features

The current featureset includes:

* Viewing tasks (duh) sorted and grouped in various ways.
* Marking a pending task as done.
* Creating a new task with a due date, project, and tags.
* `task-web` will pull your `task` config (from `.taskrc`) and use it to
  determine date formatting and when an upcoming task should be marked as
  "due".

I'm looking to include more features once `task` supports issuing commands via
UUID.

## Known Issues
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/theunraveler/taskwarrior-web.png)](http://travis-ci.org/theunraveler/taskwarrior-web)

* The "View as list"/"View as Grid" links do nothing right now. (They will
  soon).
* There are occasionally pretty severe race conditions due to the way that
  `task` assigns IDs to tasks. This will no longer be the case when UUIDs are
  implemented in `task`.

## Marginalia

This project is not developed by the Taskwarrior team. Obviously,
taskwarrior-web extends Taskwarrior, but the projects are separate.
